# Financial Analysis System with Agentic AI

A real-world financial analysis system powered by agentic AI that can reason, plan, and act through multiple specialized LLM agents to handle complex financial tasks end-to-end.

## Overview

This project implements a multi-agent system for financial analysis that goes beyond traditional scripted pipelines. The system features:

- **Intelligent Task Routing**: Agents automatically route tasks to specialized components
- **Self-Critique and Improvement**: Agents can evaluate their own performance and iterate
- **Real-time Market Analysis**: Parse news, earnings, and market signals at scale
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Specialized agents work together on complex financial tasks

## Architecture

The system consists of several specialized agents:

- **Data Ingestion Agent**: Handles real-time market data, news feeds, and financial reports
- **Analysis Agent**: Performs technical and fundamental analysis
- **Risk Assessment Agent**: Evaluates portfolio risk and market conditions
- **Decision Agent**: Makes investment recommendations based on analysis
- **Monitoring Agent**: Tracks performance and triggers alerts

## Features
